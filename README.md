<b>
I have been working in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP and Computer Vision-based models. A data scientist with more than 3 years of experience. Expertise in model development to deployment lifecycle. I provide required solutions to business problems by working on its statistical and analytical approach. </b>
</br>

<h2><b>ML and DL Projects:</b></h2>
Completed regression, classification, clustering and time series projects in Python using Scikit-Learn. Codes are 
available here on GitHub.<br>
Implemented CNN on images and videos. Good knowledge of Image segmentation, classification and Detection.<br>
Experience in NLP for sentiment analysis and text classification. All codes are available here on the GitHub. <br>
Experience in Kaggle competition in Natural language processing and forecasting. <br>
worked on medical imaging projects that involve classification, object  detection, segmentation and tracking.<br>
Real time fire detection system using CNN. Integrated that model in flutter app that detect the event and send a notification message with location and exact time.(Client project)<br>
Smart-attendance system using face recognition <br>
<h2><b>Anomaly Detection from Video Streams Using Deep Learning techniques (FYP): </b></h2>
Set up a system that was efficient enough to Detect and classify unusual activities from video streams.</br>
Worked on 3 Anomalous categories (Fighting, Shoplifting and Explosion) and achieved accuracy of 82%. </br>
Developed a flutter application as a use case of our project that uses real time camera for video streams</br>
Served the flask API on Hureko Server. Details of the project are available here.</br>
<h2><b>Arrhythmia Detection Using Deep Learning Techniques (Research Project):<b></h2>
Classified ECG signal using a Conventional Neural Network (CNN) & LSTM.</br>
Submitted the paper to IEEE Transactions on Biomedical circuits and systems. Codes are available here on the GitHub.</br>
<h2><b>Model Deployment:<b></h2>
Served Flask ML and DL APIs on Hureko Server. </br>
Deployed of ML Model on AWS Server (Amazon SageMaker).</br>
<h2><b>Web Scrapping:<b></h2>
Scraped different websites using Scrapy, beautiful soup, and Parsehub. </br>
Scraped product data across different domains for analysis.</br>
<h2><b>Semester Projects:</b></h2>
Space shooter game in python (4 Level).<br>
TIC TAC TOE game and Console Based online delivery system in C++.<br>
Automatic Street Light using PIR Sensor, Fire Alarm, Firefighting Robot. <br>
